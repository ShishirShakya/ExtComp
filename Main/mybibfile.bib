Hence range-based Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation produces highly efficient estimates of stochastic volatility models and extractions of latent volatility.We use our method to examine the dynamics of daily exchange rate volatility and find the evidence points strongly toward two-factor models with one highly persistent factor and one quickly mean-reverting factor.

abstract = {In this paper we exploit newly introduced implied volatility indexes to investigate the directional risk transfer from oil to US equities, Euro/Dollar exchange rates, precious metals and agricultural commodities. We find significant volatility transmission from oil to equities but little transmission to agricultural commodities. The total pairwise directional connectedness to equities is around 20.4{\%}, while it is only 1.6{\%}, 1.0{\%} and 2.0{\%} to wheat, corn, and soybeans respectively. The risk spillover from oil to precious metals and Euro/Dollar foreign exchange rates is moderate. For instance, the oil market uncertainty spills 11.0{\%}, 11.1{\%} and 8.9{\%} to gold, silver and Euro/Dollar exchange rate respectively. The volatility crossover from all of these markets to oil is tiny, implying that oil is the main driver of its association with these markets. Finally, we provide evidence that the transmission from oil to other markets has increased since the collapse of oil prices in July 2014.},

abstract = {Risk management has generally focused on aggregate connectedness, overlooking its cyclical sources. We argue that the frequency dynamics is insightful for studying this connectedness because shocks with heterogeneous frequency responses create linkages with various degrees of persistence. Such connections are important for understanding the possible sources of systemic risk specific to economic cycles but remain hidden when aggregate measures of connectedness are used. To estimate connectedness on short-, medium-, and long-term financial cycles, we propose a general framework based on spectral representation of variance decompositions. In an empirical application, we document the rich dynamics of volatility connectedness in the US financial institutions with short-term connections due to contemporaneous correlations as well as significant weekly, monthly, and longer connections that play a role. Hence, we find that the financial market clears part of the information but that the permanent changes in investors' expectations having longer-term responses are non-negligible.},

While dualistic models highlighted the importance of agriculture, the mainstream literature placed a greater emphasis on the creation of a modern industrial sector. Soon agriculture disappeared from the mainstream development literature to re-emerge recently with a variety of multiple-sector growth models emphasizing the key role of agriculture and specifically technology in agriculture. This article is an empirical cross-country analysis of agricultural technology's role in economic development. Specifically, the hypothesis being tested is whether improvements in agricultural technology have a significant impact on long-run economic growth. The results indicate that agricultural modernization has a positive effect on both measures of economic growth and human development.},

These measures can also identify and quantify financial crisis periods, and seem to contain predictive power in out-of-sample tests.

We formulate a flexible yet parsimonious parametric model in which the daily realized volatility of a given exchange rate depends both on its own lags as well as on the lagged realized volatilities of the other exchange rates. We find evidence of statistically significant intra-regional volatility spillovers among the CE foreign exchange markets. With the exception of the Czech and, prior to the recent turbulent economic events, Polish currencies, we find no significant spillovers running from the EUR/USD to the CE foreign exchange markets. To measure the overall magnitude and evolution of volatility transmission over time, we construct a dynamic version of the Diebold-Yilmaz volatility spillover index and show that volatility spillovers tend to increase in periods characterized by market uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

"Best" analytic estimators, which simultaneously use the high, low, opening, and closing prices, are formulated in Section V. Section VI considers the complications raised by trading volume.

This enables us to obtain indicators of how well connected a country is into the global trading system. We use these network-based measures of connectedness to explain stock market returns during recent episodes of financial crisis. We find that a crisis is amplified if the epicenter country is better integrated into the trade network. However, target countries affected by such a shock are in turn better able to dissipate the impact if they are well integrated into the network. A network approach can help explain why the Mexican, Asian, and Russian financial crises were highly contagious, while the crises that originated in Venezuela and Argentina did not have such a virulent effect. We suggest that a network approach incorporating the cascading and diffusion of interdependent ripples when a shock hits a specific part of the global trade network provides us with an improved explanation of financial contagion.

In line with this finding, we find that structural shifts, when they do exist, are contained in country-specific factors. Furthermore, consistent with economic theory, this global factor is closely related to a trend in the global interest rate, while country-specific factors are closely related to idiosyncratic movements in the countries' own interest rates. Such a decomposition results in better understanding of the exchange rate-interest rate relationship, and therefore our results can be interpreted as evidence that external competitiveness is heterogeneous among countries and that economic policies can influence countries' competitiveness.},
